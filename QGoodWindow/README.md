**QGoodWindow** gives to your application full control of the window while keeps native OS window behavior, like minimize effect.

**QGoodWindow** project is split in two modules, the  **QGoodWindow** and **QGoodCentralWidget**.

**QGoodWindow** provides the core of the project and can be used without **QGoodCentralWidget**, however **QGoodCentralWidget** offers a ready to use window with icon, title, caption buttons and a easy way to add widgets to the title bar.

**QGoodWindow** Usage:

*CMake:*

For use **QGoodWindow** add to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

    include(path_to/QGoodWindow/QGoodWindow.cmake)

For use **QGoodCentralWidget** add to your `CMakeLists.txt` after  **QGoodWindow**:

    include(path_to/QGoodCentralWidget/QGoodCentralWidget.cmake)

*QMake:*

For use **QGoodWindow** add to your `.pro`:

    include(path_to/QGoodWindow/QGoodWindow.pri)

For use **QGoodCentralWidget** add to your `.pro` after  **QGoodWindow**:

    include(path_to/QGoodCentralWidget/QGoodCentralWidget.pri)

To use **QGoodWindow** in your project add `#include <QGoodWindow>` in your code, then use  `QGoodWindow`  as  `QMainWindow`, for example, create an instance of  `QGoodWindow`  or sub class it.

To use **QGoodCentralWidget**  add `#include <QGoodCentralWidget>` in your code, set it as central widget of **QGoodWindow** and set to the **QGoodCentralWidget** it's own central widget.
